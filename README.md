## Caesar_Cipher_Encrypt_Decrypt

This tool allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher, a simple substitution cipher where each letter is shifted a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have Python 3 installed.

3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script file is located.

4. Run the script by executing the command `python3 caesar_cipher.py`.

5. Choose an operation: `encrypt` or `decrypt`.

6. If you choose `encrypt`, enter the plaintext (the text you want to encrypt) when prompted. Then, enter the shift value, which determines how much each letter is shifted in the cipher.

7. If you choose `decrypt`, enter the ciphertext (the encrypted text) when prompted. Then, enter the same shift value you used for encryption.

8. The program will display the resulting ciphertext (if you chose encryption) or the plaintext (if you chose decryption).

9. You can repeat the process to encrypt or decrypt different texts with different shift values.

**Note:** The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption method and not suitable for secure encryption purposes. It is primarily used for educational or basic learning purposes.

## Example

Here's an example interaction with the program:

Choose an operation (encrypt/decrypt): encrypt
Enter the plaintext: Hello, World!
Enter the shift value: 3
Ciphertext: Khoor, Zruog!

Choose an operation (encrypt/decrypt): decrypt
Enter the ciphertext: Khoor, Zruog!
Enter the shift value: 3
Plaintext: Hello, World!
